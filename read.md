### Overview of project: 

Lileli is a website dedicated to eradicating the stigma associated with any form of abuse. To raise awareness about the fact that people are mistreated every day, with many unaware, and to educate the public about the abuse culture. Its purpose is to build a community in which people may share their tales and meet people who can assist them in their healing process. 

We offer resources that are both educational and understandable to young adults. For example, our Comics are simple and enjoyable to study; these are true stories from our community created just for you. We aim to address the ongoing issue in today's society by teaching everyone about the negative impacts of abuse, and we feel that doing so would help to minimize the alarmingly high rate of assaults/harassment that has been increasing on a daily basis.

A 20-question questionnaire has been linked to the website to assess users' awareness of Consent and Sexual Harassment. With the rising number of assault cases in the workplace, homes, friendships, and relationships, it is critical to educate everyone and guarantee that we are all educated and not violating the rights of others.

## Project Goal 

Lileli is a safe environment dedicated to educating the public about the many types of abuse and their consequences via the use of comic books. We believe that by offering first-hand information on the subject, we can ensure that everyone understands their rights and respects the rights of others.

Our community's experiences would be utilized to make our comics , which would address an ongoing issue in today's culture by training young adults to speak up when they are exploited/harrased/mistreated. This website is aimed towards persons above the age of 18, with the goal of educating them as well as providing a secure space for people to share their stories and learn new things.

The goal of this project is to construct a quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on the topics of Consent and Sexual Harassment, plus a few scenario questions to really put your knowledge to the test. Once finished, the user is given results based on their scores, as well as brief information and links to further educate them on their understandings of consent. We feel that by sharing all of these materials, we are helping to fight sexual harassment/abuse of all kinds and making the world a safer place.
