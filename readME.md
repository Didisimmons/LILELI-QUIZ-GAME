# LILELI

[View deployed site](https://didisimmons.github.io/LILELI-QUIZ-GAME/)

### Overview of project: 

Lileli is a website created for a London-based entrepreneur who is committed to removing the stigma connected with any sort of abuse through comics. Raising awareness about the reality that people are mistreated on a daily basis, with many people being ignorant, and educating the public about the abuse culture. Its goal is to create a community where people can share their stories and meet people who can help them heal.

We provide resources for young adults that are both instructive and understandable. For example, our Comics are simple and pleasant to read; these are actual stories from our community developed exclusively for you, therefore our slogan "comic made by you for you." We hope to solve the ongoing problem in today's society by educating everyone about the harmful consequences of abuse, and we believe that doing so will help to reduce the dangerously high rate of assaults/harassment that has been increasing on a daily basis.

A 20-question questionnaire has been linked to the website to assess users' awareness of Consent and Sexual Harassment. With the rising number of assault cases in the workplace, homes, friendships, and relationships, it is critical to educate everyone and guarantee that we are all educated and not violating the rights of others.

## Project Goal 

Lileli is a safe environment dedicated to educating the public about the many types of abuse and their consequences via the use of comic books. We believe that by offering first-hand information on the subject, we can ensure that everyone understands their rights and respects the rights of others.

Our community's experiences would be utilized to make our comics , which would address an ongoing issue in today's culture by training young adults to speak up when they are exploited/harrased/mistreated. This website is aimed towards persons above the age of 18, with the goal of educating them as well as providing a secure space for people to share their stories and learn new things.

The goal of this project is to construct a quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on the topics of Consent and Sexual Harassment, plus a few scenario questions to really put your knowledge to the test. Once finished, the user is given results based on their scores, as well as brief information and links to further educate them on their understandings of consent. We feel that by sharing all of these materials, we are helping to fight sexual harassment/abuse of all kinds and making the world a safer place.

## Design

* Colour Scheme

    -  The colors used in the site's design were developed using the colorspace website. The [spotpallete] (https://mycolor.space/?hex= percent 23845EC2&sub=1) was chosen.


    - The colours reflect LILELI's brand in order to convey trust and a comfortable space to consumers, as purple represents royalty and has long been connected with abuse victims. To keep the site clean and simple, a white pallete is offered.
    
* Typography

  - The Oswald and EB Garamond typefaces are used throughout the site to provide consistency. The two fonts provide our site a friendly, distinct and appealing appearance to our target demographic.

* Imagery 

  - Most of the photos used on the site were obtained from the entrepreneur Teni Fashanu. The logo , hero image, the product images and the images used to to create the background picture for certain sections. However some of these images were modified using phtoshop for the background images, 

  - The photos utilized depict what to expect from LILELI's comics as well as the welcoming environment you can expect when you join our community. The photographs are aimed at a certain demographic in order to capture their attention and portray a secure sanctuary.
  
  - Images from free image providers such as Unsplash were used on the other pages.

* Videos 
   
   - The homepage video was received from entrepreneur Teni Fashanu and was made by Henryhousefilms.
