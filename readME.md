# LILELI

[View deployed site](https://didisimmons.github.io/LILELI-QUIZ-GAME/)

### Overview of project: 

Lileli is a website created for a London-based entrepreneur who is committed to removing the stigma connected with any sort of abuse through comics. Raising awareness about the reality that people are mistreated on a daily basis, with many people being ignorant, and educating the public about the abuse culture. Its goal is to create a community where people can share their stories and meet people who can help them heal.

We provide resources for young adults that are both instructive and understandable. For example, our Comics are simple and pleasant to read; these are actual stories from our community developed exclusively for you, therefore our slogan "comic made by you for you." We hope to solve the ongoing problem in today's society by educating everyone about the harmful consequences of abuse, and we believe that doing so will help to reduce the dangerously high rate of assaults/harassment that has been increasing on a daily basis.

A 20-question questionnaire has been linked to the website to assess users' awareness of Consent and Sexual Harassment. With the rising number of assault cases in the workplace, homes, friendships, and relationships, it is critical to educate everyone and guarantee that we are all educated and not violating the rights of others.

## Project Goal 

Lileli is a safe environment dedicated to educating the public about the many types of abuse and their consequences via the use of comic books. We believe that by offering first-hand information on the subject, we can ensure that everyone understands their rights and respects the rights of others.

Our community's experiences would be utilized to make our comics , which would address an ongoing issue in today's culture by training young adults to speak up when they are exploited/harrased/mistreated. This website is aimed towards persons above the age of 18, with the goal of educating them as well as providing a secure space for people to share their stories and learn new things.

The goal of this project is to construct a quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on the topics of Consent and Sexual Harassment, plus a few scenario questions to really put your knowledge to the test. Once finished, the user is given results based on their scores, as well as brief information and links to further educate them on their understandings of consent. We feel that by sharing all of these materials, we are helping to fight sexual harassment/abuse of all kinds and making the world a safer place.

## Design

* Colour Scheme

    -  The colors used in the site's design were developed using the colorspace website. The [spotpallete] (https://mycolor.space/?hex= percent 23845EC2&sub=1) was chosen.

    - The colours reflect LILELI's brand in order to convey trust and a comfortable space to consumers, as purple represents royalty and has long been connected with abuse victims. To keep the site clean and simple, a white pallete is offered.
    
* Typography

  - To ensure consistency and to give the site a distinct and friendly image, the typefaces Poppins and Lato are used throughout. The two fonts help to make the site approachable and appealing to our target demographic. There is also a backup font included.

* Imagery 

  - Most of the photos used on the site were obtained from the entrepreneur Teni Fashanu. The logo , hero image, the product images and the images used to to create the background picture for certain sections. However some of these images were modified using phtoshop for the background images, 

  - The photos utilized depict what to expect from LILELI's comics as well as the welcoming environment you can expect when you join our community. The photographs are aimed at a certain demographic in order to capture their attention and portray a secure sanctuary.
  
  - Images from free image providers such as Unsplash were used on the other pages.

* Videos 
   
   - The homepage video was received from entrepreneur Teni Fashanu and was made by Henryhousefilms.

### Wireframes:  

The full site's wireframe is available [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/jQcJQcFWw9uGwa3Z84LfbX/Lileli?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2). This displays the site on both a desktop and a mobile device, along with its interactions.


## FEATURES
Each of the pages designed for the website contain different content that appeal to the user. 


### HOMEPAGE 
The homepage has a fully responsive navigation bar with the logo on the left and three different links (about, products, and rooms) on the right. When a user adjusts the screen to a mobile device, the three different links on the right move to the centre of the screen, leaving the logo alone. 

The hero image is displayed beneath the navigation bar in order to catch the user's attention. The header text and tag line text have a zoom in effect that makes them visually appealing to the user.

The about section is located beneath the hero image and provides the user with a brief overview of LILELI’s mission. This gives users a small amount of trust in what LILELI is about and how it might be useful for them to stay engaged on the site.


A video has been added under the about section to raise awareness about the abuse culture and how LILELI can help you. The video's goal is to show abuse victims that they are not alone and that we are all in this together. Under the video content, there is a read more button that allows the user to see more weekly information about LILELI on their blog. This gives the user confidence in the LILELI brand and materials for self-research and education.

The review section is located beneath the video section and displays real-life stories from our community members. These are some of the victims' stories about what they've been through and what you can expect from the lessons in our comics once you buy them. 
A brief compelling text is also included to warm the hearts of the users and demonstrate to them that as a brand, we understand and are here to help, with the goal of gaining their trust. 

This section is followed by a display of comic products. The comics are divided into three major categories, each of which, when clicked, takes the user to a page with a variety of additional comics on specific abuse topics. This displays LILELI's products and informs the user of LILELI's sole purpose. 

We have the quiz container under this section, which is placed directly beneath the product section and contains some enticing text about why you should join LILELI. It also enables the user to complete LILELI's twenty-question questionnaire on sexual harassment, abuse, and consent. This enlightens users on the subject, keeping us all informed of the importance of respecting others' rights and comprehending the concept of "consent." The user can also participate in the LILELI conversation on social media by using the hashtag #jointheconversation. The goal of LILELI is for all users to feel a sense of belonging to the LILELI community.

Finally, we have the footer section, which includes LILELI's social media on the left side and a link to their support page and a find out more link on the right side. The social media platforms demonstrate LILELI's legitimacy as a business and foster brand trust.


### START PAGE 

When the user clicks the "Take Quiz" button, the user is taken to the start page. This page includes an image that draws the user's attention to the LILELI quiz. On all devices, the image is centred with a bold text that asks the user to confirm they are over the age of 18 before they can access the quiz. The button controls enable the user to play the game or return to the homepage.


### QUIZ PAGE

The quiz page is launched after the user confirms "YES" from the start page that they are over the age of 18. The page includes two large buttons that are stacked on top of each other and display the messages "start" and "instructions." This gives the user instructions on how to play the game, and the start button directs  the user to the questions. A link to the main site has also been included. 

This procedure has been followed to ensure that the correct target audience has been reached and that we are not violating any rights by displaying sensitive content to those of an inappropriate age.

When the game begins, the following features are visible: the question counter and progress bar placed above it on the left side, and the score field on the right side. The answer options are listed at the bottom of the questions, and the user must select one to proceed to the next question. 

After completing the questionnaire, the user is given their results as well as links to additional information on Consent & Sexual Harassment. When the user closes the results, they are presented with a "PLAY AGAIN" button, which allows them to reset the game and begin again, with the option of returning to the homepage. 

### EXISTING FEATURES 

* Call to action buttons : This exist on every single page and directs the user to either the homepage, start page or the quiz page to perform their desired function.

### FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE
