### User stories Testing 

The common path for our user through LILELI website is : 

* ABOUT  > PRODUCTS  > ROOMS 
 
The user can easily navigate tthro the next page from any of the sites by lingering over any of the required five webpages. The home page is represented by the FLYBODY logo. If clicked, user would be taken to the main page of the website.

The user may quickly sign up to FLYBODY gym using the call to action button on the hero image on the home page. The user can quickly examine the amenities, benefits, team members, customer reviews and subscribe to FLYBODY newsletter in a case were the user does not interact with the other pages, this is all on one page to hasten the Sign Up process .

When the screen width is set to a desktop view, the FLYBODY logo on all devices takes the user to the homepage, and when the user hovers over any of the webpage links, it is highlighted with a light grey backdrop. The navigation bar on a tablet or mobile device is a hamburger icon that, when clicked, allows the user to hover over the five  webpages and see the grey highlight backdrop. 

- As a customer I want to : 

 1. Easily navigate the site and get the information I need to take the necessary.

    *	The home page includes a responsive navigation bar that allows the user to navigate through the various sections on the page to find the relevant information and gain an understanding of LILELI. 

    *	A brief explanation of LILELI's purpose has been provided to give users an idea of what to expect from the site. 

    * 	The user can easily navigate through the page and view real-life stories, join the community, and, if interested, participate in the available quiz. 

    *  The call to action buttons on all pages direct the user to the desired page and inform them of the next steps/action. This improves the overall user experience.

 2. The site should be visually appealing and trustworthy in order to want to join their community and share a story.
     * The site has been kept clean, with appropriate text and more images to convey LILELI's information. The images are specifically in cartoon characters to depict the vision of the upcoming comic books. This gives the user a sense of the LILELI experience. 

     * The background images on the site have been kept clean and concise so that information can be placed on top of them that is appealing to our target demographic.  

    * The user can easily navigate through the page and view real-life stories, join the community, and, if interested, participate in the available quiz. 

    *  A video and a story section have been added to the site to demonstrate LILELI's goal of raising awareness and how the LILELI website is designed to be a safe haven for all. Because our comic is created by everyone for everyone. 

 3. Easily find LILELI online on their social networks to learn more about the brand and confirm its legitimacy and trustworthiness.
    *  There is a footer section on the homepage that provides the user with links to LILELI's social media platforms. The user can easily visit their pages and conduct additional research on them.  

    * On the right side of the footer, there are two more links that provide the user with additional information about LILELI's works and our community. To avoid overloading the user with information on the main page, this has been provided as external links that direct the user to another page.  

4. Be able to readily view the questions and learn something new when I take the quiz.
    *  The background image of the quiz container draws the user's attention to the quiz button. The quiz can be easily engaged with as the user navigates down the homepage and flows through the webpage content before reaching the footer content.  

    *  When a user clicks the "Take Quiz" button, they are directed to another page to confirm their age before being able to view the 20 scenario-based quiz questionnaires.  

    *  As the user completes the quiz, they are given a score that displays some informative text that may be useful to them. There are also external links to more in-depth content on the subject. 

    *  As the user scrolls down the page, they can click on any of the call to action buttons to learn more about the specific topic or join the "rooms" to meet new people from all over the world and learn new things.

### TESTING ALL FEATURES ON EACH THE PAGES 

Chrome dev tools was used to test the responsiveness of each webpage by changing the screen sizes of the device as well as using the console in dev tools to test the quiz game and ensure it is free of bugs and the recurring functions applied actually performed their desired functions without any bugs.

### Homepage 

1.	Visit the homepage on a desktop device . 

2.	Confirm that the navigation bar appears with a zoom in effect that appeals to the user as the page is visited.

    When the test is performed by adjusting the screen size to that of a tablet or mobile device, the effect is seen to occur as expected, with no text overflow. This is visually appealing and inviting to the user.

3.	 Adjust the desktop screen size to that of a tablet device to ensure the navigation bar is responsive and the menu items adjust to the screen size while remaining on the right side.

     By adjusting the screen size to different breakpoints, it is possible to see that the menu items remain in the specified position to the right. As this screen is reduced to 320px or less on a small mobile device, the menu items take up the centre of the navigation bar, with the LILELI's emblem on the left. The menu items and logo adjust to all screen sizes and remain in the intended position.
